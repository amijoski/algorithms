# Algorithms

1) BouncingBalls is an event-driven implementation of a mathematical N-body simulation. More information:

2) GeometricQuickSort is an implementation of quicksort for efficient detection of
collinear points on the plane. More information:
https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/collinear/specification.php

3) Kd tree is an implementation of the Kd-tree data structure 
for efficient range searches and nearest neighbour calculations on the plane, which easily generalizes 
to multiple dimensions. More information:

4) Max Flow sports is an example of using the Max Flow model to detect if a baseball team is eliminated from 
the title race. More information:

5) Percolation using union find is an application of the union-find data structure for efficient numerical 
calculation of the percolating constant on 2D grids. More information:

6) Randomized queue is an implementation of a queue data structure with random element returned when
dequeue is called. More information:

7) Seam carver is deterministic algorithm used to resize images without losing information.

8) WordNet is an acyclic digraph where each vertex is a family of synonyms, and each directed edge is a connection
from a more specific family of synonyms to more abstract. Example: (dog, hound) -> (domestic_animal).
